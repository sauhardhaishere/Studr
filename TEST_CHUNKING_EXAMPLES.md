# Smart Test Chunking - Examples

## How It Works

When you tell Studr about a test with advance notice, the AI intelligently breaks down your study preparation into multiple manageable sessions. This prevents cramming and reduces burnout.

## Example 1: The Overwhelmed Athlete

**User Input:**
```
"I have a Chem midterm in 2 weeks and I have practice every day until 6"
```

**Studr AI Response:**
```
"Got it! I've created a study plan for your Chem prep. Starting with reviewing notes, 
then practice problems, and a mock test before the final review. You've got this!"
```

**Created Tasks:**
1. **Chem - Review Notes** - Tomorrow, 30 minutes (Medium Priority)
2. **Chem - Practice Problems** - Next Monday, 45 minutes (Medium Priority)
3. **Chem - Mock Test** - Next Wednesday, 45 minutes (High Priority)
4. **Chem - Final Review** - Next Friday, 30 minutes (High Priority)
5. **Chem Midterm** - Next Saturday, 45 minutes (High Priority)

**Strategy:**
- **Review Notes**: Start by reviewing your class notes and textbook
- **Practice Problems**: Work through problem sets to apply concepts
- **Mock Test**: Take a practice exam to identify weak areas
- **Final Review**: Quick comprehensive review before the test
- **Actual Test**: The midterm itself

## Example 2: Biology Final

**User Input:**
```
"Biology final in 3 weeks"
```

**Studr AI Response:**
```
"Got it! I've created a study plan for your Biology prep. Starting with reviewing notes, 
then practice problems, and a mock test before the final review. You've got this!"
```

**Created Tasks:**
1. **Biology - Review Notes** - Tomorrow, 30m
2. **Biology - Practice Problems** - Next Monday, 45m
3. **Biology - Mock Test** - Next Wednesday, 45m
4. **Biology - Final Review** - Next Friday, 30m
5. **Biology Final** - Next Saturday, 60m

## Example 3: Quick Quiz (No Chunking)

**User Input:**
```
"Math quiz tomorrow"
```

**Studr AI Response:**
```
"Perfect! I've added your Math Quiz for Tomorrow."
```

**Created Tasks:**
1. **Math Quiz** - Tomorrow, 45 minutes (High Priority)

**Note:** No chunking because there's not enough advance time. The AI recognizes this is urgent and creates a single focused study session.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Scheduling
- **Weekends**: Longer sessions (45 minutes) when you have more time
- **Weekdays**: Shorter sessions (20 minutes) to fit around school and activities
- **Final Review**: Always includes a comprehensive review before the test

### Burnout Prevention
- Sessions are kept manageable (20-45 minutes)
- Spread across multiple days to avoid cramming
- Considers your existing schedule (practice, activities, etc.)

### Adaptive to Your Schedule
The AI considers:
- Your mentioned activities (e.g., "practice every day until 6")
- Your class schedule
- Your personal activities
- Available time slots

## How to Use

Just tell Studr about your test naturally:
- "I have a [subject] [test/midterm/exam/final] in [time period]"
- Optional: Mention your schedule constraints

Examples:
- "Chemistry midterm in 2 weeks and I have soccer practice daily"
- "AP Bio final next month"
- "History test in 10 days and I work on weekends"
- "Physics exam in 3 weeks"

The AI will automatically:
1. Detect the advance notice
2. Consider your schedule
3. Create an optimal study plan
4. Break it into manageable chunks
5. Explain the strategy to you
