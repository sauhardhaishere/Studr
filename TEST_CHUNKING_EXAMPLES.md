# Smart Test Chunking - Examples

## Test Preparation Chunking Examples

When you tell Calendly about a test with advance notice, the AI intelligently breaks down your study preparation into multiple manageable sessions. This prevents cramming and reduces burnout.

Here are some examples of how the AI handles different inputs:

### Example 1: Standard Test Notice (1 Week Away)

**User:** "I have a Math midterm in 1 week"

**Calendly AI Response:**
"Got it! I've created a 5-day study plan for your Math midterm. Starting with reviewing notes, then practice problems, and a mock test before the final review. You've got this!"

**New Tasks Created:**
1. **Math - Review Notes** (Tomorrow, 30 min)
2. **Math - Practice Problems** (Next Monday, 45 min)
3. **Math - Mock Test** (Next Wednesday, 45 min)
4. **Math - Final Review** (Next Friday, 30 min)
5. **Math Midterm** (Next Saturday, 45 min)

### Example 2: Urgent Test (2 Days Away)

**User:** "Wait, I just realized I have a Chem test on Wednesday!" (Sent on Monday)

**Calendly AI Response:**
"No problem! I've quickly added a focused study session for today and a final review for tomorrow to get you ready for that Chem test on Wednesday. Let's do this!"

**New Tasks Created:**
1. **Chem - Focused Prep** (Today, 45 min)
2. **Chem - Final Review** (Tomorrow, 30 min)
3. **Chem Test** (Wednesday, 45 min)

### Example 3: Long-term Planning (3 Weeks Away)

**User:** "I have a huge Bio final in 3 weeks"

**Calendly AI Response:**
"A huge final deserves a solid plan! I've scheduled your Bio final in 3 weeks and mapped out 4 strategic study sessions starting next week so you can take it slow and steady. You're going to crush it!"

**New Tasks Created:**
1. **Bio - Content Review** (In 1 week, 45 min)
2. **Bio - Concept Mapping** (In 1.5 weeks, 45 min)
3. **Bio - Practice Exam** (In 2 weeks, 1 hour)
4. **Bio - Final Polish** (2 days before test, 30 min)
5. **Bio Final** (In 3 weeks)

### Pro-Tips for Best Results:
Just tell Calendly about your test naturally:
- "History test next Friday"
- "Spanish exam on the 20th"
- "I have my Physics midterm in three weeks"

The AI will handle the rest!

### Intelligent Scheduling
- **Weekends**: Longer sessions (45 minutes) when you have more time
- **Weekdays**: Shorter sessions (20 minutes) to fit around school and activities
- **Final Review**: Always includes a comprehensive review before the test

### Burnout Prevention
- Sessions are kept manageable (20-45 minutes)
- Spread across multiple days to avoid cramming
- Considers your existing schedule (practice, activities, etc.)

### Adaptive to Your Schedule
The AI considers:
- Your mentioned activities (e.g., "practice every day until 6")
- Your class schedule
- Your personal activities
- Available time slots

## How to Use

Just tell Studr about your test naturally:
- "I have a [subject] [test/midterm/exam/final] in [time period]"
- Optional: Mention your schedule constraints

Examples:
- "Chemistry midterm in 2 weeks and I have soccer practice daily"
- "AP Bio final next month"
- "History test in 10 days and I work on weekends"
- "Physics exam in 3 weeks"

The AI will automatically:
1. Detect the advance notice
2. Consider your schedule
3. Create an optimal study plan
4. Break it into manageable chunks
5. Explain the strategy to you
